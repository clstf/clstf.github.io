                <p class="text">
                    So where does coffee come from? <br>
                    Its truthfull origin is not known, but once it is supposed to come from ethiopia, there is obviously an  ethiopian legend. <br>
                    There was a young shepperd that spent his time with his goats on hills.His name was Kaldi and to help time pass by, he played the flute. When the day was over he played a specific music and his goats would come to him. <br>
                    Except there was one day on which his goats did not respond to his calling. 
                    Tired of playing and waiting he went to look for them.<br>
                    When he found them, they were too excited and he noticed that they were chewing a small tree that had berries, and that he had never noticed before.<br>
                    He decided to try some of those berries. That was when he started feeling active and excited too.<br>
                    Imediately he repported this happenings to the village. And thus, coffee was discovered.<br>
                    How it came from the berries to the roasting is not exactly known.<br>
                    Some say Kaldi told the effects of the berries to an abbot from a nearby monastery. The monks would then consider it a matter of the devil and burnt the plant. The second the beans roasted they smelled so delicious that they made a tea with it.
                    Some say it would be accidental.<br>
            
                    Some say it was a matter of preserving the berries.<br>
                    
                    The truth is that these berries would travel the world and would be used in different occasions, but the result was undoubtefully noticable. It would keep consumers awake and sharp.<br>
                    
                    They were used in different tribes and empires.<br>
                    The turkish took over this consumption and culture, creating the first coffee houses.<br>
                    
                    They would roast the beans, grind them right away and then pour hot boiling water on them. This was one of the first replacements of wine and it was quickly spread.<br>
                   
                    
                    They were so obsessed with these beans on trade, that they would boil them before trade to ensure they could not be used to grow new plants outside their kingdom.<br>
                    
                    Later it would reach Europe through Vienna, where new techniques for drinking coffee were concieved. Coffee started to be filtered so the grinding would pass to the cup. And a lot of other inovative ingredients were added. <br>
                    
                    The expresso shot was "invented" in Italy, were public was too impatient to wait for the brewing of the coffee in the traditional way, so it was a less amount of coffee through which water is pressured and served in a small cup. 
                    
                    These days Coffee is the most sold legal stimulant. <br>

                    So there two different types of coffee beans. They are Arabica and Robusta.<br>
                    We will start understanding Arabica. <br>
                    These are the higher quality beans and represent about 70% of the world production. it is also believed it was the first type of coffee to be planted. <br>
                    The beans are grown on mountains hills and sides, where its farming is more difficult, but allows no use of pesticide. Requires humid soils and plenty of shadow as well as medium range temperature.<br>
                    The berries must be collected only when red. This will ensure the greater quality on the beans afterwards.<br>
                    
                    After being collected it is necessary to ensure that only the ripest berries are processed.<br>
                      
                    There two processes one is called the dry method. which consists on simply spreading the beans through a large surface and allowing them to dry until the moisture of the content of the berries drops to 11%.<br>
                    
                    The other is the wet method, on which the beans are separated through water. The lighter ones will float, and sequentially they will be separated in sizes.<br>
                      
                    After separation they are taken to fermentation process on which water and natural enzimes will remove the rest of the fruit and leave the berry hard to touch. After that they are dried.<br>
                      
                    The drying process is quite straight forward, the beans ( that are still inside their parchement envelope) are left on large areas to dry.<br>
                      
                    They are stored in jute or sisal bags and then exported.<br>
                      
                    Because the quality of the beans fastly decreases on roasting it's only when sold or on the producer that they are roasted and, sometimes, grinded as close to brewing as possible.<br>
                      
                    Many brands opt to conserve the beans in vacuum sealed containers.<br>
                      
                    Others just grind them and then sell them.
                      
                    And still there are the pods that roast, grind and keep them in the best conditions inside the capsules or pods.<br>
                      
                    And then it is ready to be used. At your place in your machine, percolator or caffetiere or in your coffee shop.<br>

                    It is quite hard to describe all the types of coffee there are out there.
                    But we will try to define some of them. <br>
                   <!-- We will add images to help illustrate this.<br>-->
                    The six major coffee types are expresso, lungo, americano, macchiato, cappucino, mocha and latte.<br>
                      
                    
                    
                    So let's start with the simple and the base of all the others: an expresso.<br>
                    An expresso is a small cup of coffee, aproximately 25ml. The portion of ground coffee is 7g and the temperature of the water is 88ºC.<br>
                    So basically it is a portion of coffee through which hot water is pressure and that contains concentrated amount of caffeine. But because it is a smaller quantity it has less coffee than a mug of brewed coffee.<br>
                    <!-- image of expresso (cup or wtv )-->
                  
                    A lungo is simply an expresso, but with more quantity of water. The same amount of coffee is inserted in the portafilter, but the machine passes more water through it.<br>
                    Thus resulting in a bitter flavour, due to the coffee beans being "burned" over the capacity of its original capacity.<br>
                    <!--image of a lungo-->
                    
               
                    An americano is simply an expresso with hot water added to it. Not hot water that passes through the coffee on the portafilter, but simply hot water added to the expresso served on a big cup.<br>
                    <!--americano image..-->
                    
                    Macchiato.<br>
                    It is a simple expresso with a part of foamed milk.<br>
                    <!--macchiato image-->
                    
                    Next on our list is the Cappucino.<br>
                    It is a complex drink made with a single expresso shot, topped with frothed milk.<br>
                    It is not the expresso that makes it complex, but the milk frothing process. It is done to a specific temperature and the steamer must be in a precise angle.<br>
                    It takes a lot of art to make a beautifull capuccino. Baristas take a lot of effort on this and they create the most amazing patterns on a single cup. <br>
                    Sometimes they even finish it with some chocolate or cinnamon sprinkles.<br>
                    It is just amazing beverage!<br>
                    <!--cappucino image-->
                    
                
                    What about  a mocha?<br>
                    Well, a mocha is a cappucino but before the frothed milk, a portion of hot chocolate is added to it. It is also called the vienese coffee, because it was supposed to have been created in Vienna.<br>
                    <!-- mocha mocha -->
                   
                    Finally a latte is a three layered coffee. First the bottom layer is a single expresso shot, the second is steamed milk and then at the top a bit of milk foam.<br>
                    If you opt to do a flat white all you have to do is simply not add the foam at the top and voilá.<br>
